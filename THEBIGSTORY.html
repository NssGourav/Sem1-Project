        <h2 id="intro">1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>In 2001, a perspective article published in IEEE Computer, entitled “Artificial Consciousness: Mission Impossible?” Buttazzo (2001) supported a line of thought aimed at showing that there are no conceptual obstacles to the development of conscious machines, observing that all the criticisms raised over the years to undermine this possibility can easily be disassembled with logical reasoning and scientific evidence. 
        <p style="padding-top: 5px;">Then, it illustrated how to predict when the conditions necessary for the development of conscious machines can be reached, indicating year 2029 as a possible date.</p>
        <p style="padding-top: 5px;"> After more than twenty years and in light of the most recent advances in artificial intelligence, is this estimate still realistic? Is the disruptive event referred to as “technological singularity” in which machines will reach human intellectual abilities ever closer? What will happen next? What will change in society? What are the jobs that artificial intelligence puts at risk? Thinking about these questions is of fundamental importance to predict possible future scenarios and prepare ourselves to face the consequences.</p>

        <p style="padding-top: 5px;">This article traces the main milestones that led to the development of deep learning, illustrating the current capabilities of existing neural models and discussing the possible risks and opportunities of this technology, both in the short and long terms.</p>
        <h2 id="neural">2. Evolution of Neural Networks</h2>



        <p>Artificial intelligence, particularly artificial neural networks, has a fluctuating path with periods of enthusiasm and little interest. The binary threshold neuron, proposed in 1943, was not capable of learning and was mainly used to simulate biological neural circuits.</p>
        <p style="padding-top: 5px;"> In 1949, Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb discovered that learning only operates on synaptic connections, which modulate communication between neurons. Rosenblatt developed the first model of artificial neuron capable of learning, the Perceptron, in 1957.</p>
        <p style="padding-top: 5px;">This model had variable weights that could be modified according to the error committed by the neuron, allowing it to associate inputs with desired output values.</p>
        <p style="padding-top: 5px;"> However, interest in neural networks declined in 1969 when the Perceptron failed to learn the simple logic function of a two-input exclusive OR. Interest in neural networks revived in the early 1980s with Hopfield's proposed model of an associative memory, Reinforcement Learning, and Backpropagation.</p>
        <p style="padding-top: 5px;">Neural networks have been used to solve various problems in various sectors, but there were no substantial theoretical advances until the end of the 20th century.</p>

        <h2 id="deep">3. Explosion of Deep Learning</h2>
        <p style="padding-top: 5px;">. Explosion of deep learning
            In the early 2000s, neural network research experienced a huge upswing thanks to a number of conjoint factors. The first factor is of a theoretical nature: once the problems that hindered the training of multi-layered networks were understood, various solutions were devised to overcome those limitations and train networks with thousands of neurons organized in numerous layers: deep neural networks.</p>
        <p style="padding-top: 5px;"> The second factor is of a technological nature. Around 2006, computing architectures based on graphics processing units (GPUs), originally designed to parallelize graphics operations, were modified to also perform vector computations, such as those required to run a neural network, and became widespread on the market at an affordable cost. The third factor is instead of economic nature. </p>
         <p style="padding-top: 5px;margin-top: 10px;">The first results obtained with deep neural networks have attracted the interest of large companies, such as Google, Microsoft, and Facebook which, managing an enormous amount of data, have seen in neural networks a great opportunity to solve image classification problems, recognition of faces, sounds, voices, and have therefore begun to invest large amounts of resources in this sector. Then, the rapid evolution of cloud computing, public repositories, and high speed communication networks gave the possibility to many researchers to exploit such data to train and test new machine learning models. Finally, another element that contributed to the evolution of deep networks was the international competition ImageNet,2 or more precisely the “ImageNet Large-Scale Visual Recognition Challenge” (ILSVRC), a sort of annual computer vision Olympics, born in 2010 to stimulate the development of algorithms for solving complex problems, such as image classification and segmentation.</p> 
        <p style="padding-top: 5px;">Below Figure illustrates how the classification error of the algorithms that won the competition has reduced over the years, from 2010 to 2017.</p>
        <img style="display: justify;" src="./imageforthebig.jpg"><img>

        <p style="padding-top: 10px;">To have a more realistic prediction, it must be said that current machine learning models have several shortcomings that should necessarily be overcome before they can be used in safety-critical systems, as autonomous cars, planes, trains, and robots.</p>
        <p style="margin: auto;"> For instance, AI algorithms can react in unexpected ways when asked to take decisions in corner situations badly covered by training. They are also prone to cyber attacks (also called adversarial attacks), which can cause a neural model to provide a wrong output by slightly modifying the input so that it appears genuine to humans (Yuan et al., 2019). Finally, given the high societal impact of deep neural networks and AI in general, their use and deployment will probably be regulated by governments, as it is done in the field of genetic engineering. Considering such collateral issues, the reach of the singularity could be delayed by some years, appearing between 2040 and 2050 (Müller and Bostrom, 2016).</p>

        <p style="padding-top:10px;";>It is worth noting that the singularity refers to the moment in which machines match human intelligence not only in some specific fields, but in all human activities. This type of artificial intelligence is defined as artificial general intelligence (AGI), indicating an intellectual ability in all fields of knowledge.</p>
